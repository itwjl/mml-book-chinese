    "Machine learning is the latest in a long line of attempts to distill human knowledge and reasoning into a form that is suitable for constructing machines and engineering automated systems. As machine learning becomes more ubiquitous and its software packages become easier to use, it is natural and desirable that the low-level technical details are abstracted away ad hidden from the practitioner. However, this brings with it the danger that a practitioner becomes unaware of the design decisions and, hence, the limits of machine learning algorithms."

    "This book is intended to be a guidebook to the vast mathematical literature that forms the foundations of modern machine learning. We motivate the need for mathematical concepts by directly pointing out their usefulness in the context of fundamental machine learning problems. In the interest of keeping the book short, many details and more advanced concepts have been left out. Equipped with the basic concepts presented here, and how they fit into the larger context of machine learning, the reader can find numerous resources for further study, which we provide at the end of the respective chapters. For readers with a mathematical background, this book provides a brief but precisely stated glimpse of machine learning. In contrast to other books that focus on methods and models of machine learning (MacKay, 2003; Bishop, 2006; Alpaydin, 2010; Barber, 2012;Murphy, 2012; Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014; Rogers and Guido, 2016) or programmatic aspects of machine learning (Müller and Fuido, 2016;Rascka and Mirjalili 2017; Chollet and Allaire, 2018) we provide only four representative examples of machine learning algorithms. Instead, we focus on the mathmatical concepts behind the models themselves. We hope that readers will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the basic questions in machine learning and connect practical questions arising from the use of machine learning with fundamental choices in the mathematical model."
